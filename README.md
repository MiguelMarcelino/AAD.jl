# AAD.jl
In a true moment of desperation/inspiration, I started writing the algorithms from the book "Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures".
I decided to program these in Julia because: 
1. Why not
2. It will almost certainly exceed the original Java implementation performance-wise

If anything, this helps me relax in a time where my soul appears to have left my body.

## Status
The implementation still looks very pseudo-code like, as the goal is not to copy from the original repository. It should evolve with time. Hopefully...
